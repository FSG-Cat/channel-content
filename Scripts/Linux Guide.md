# Distros
Ultimately the user choice, almost every distro (even Ubuntu) is leagues ahead of windows/privacy out of the box for your privacy. Our recommendations for a majority:
- Fedora (overall simple, easy to use, and overall decent security)
- Arch (A bit more complex to set up, but has fun things like the AUR) 

# Zone 1
- Strong login & sudo Password. Also avoid root login, use sudo.
- Proper Password management for accounts and services 
- Device & File Encryption (LUKS, Veracrypt, etc.)
- Firewall (iptables, firewalld, ufw)
- Browsers Part 1 (Not Chrome)
- Search Engine (DDG, Startpage, Searx.me)
- VPNs (Proton, IVPN, Mullvad, Windscribe)
- DNS (Same as VPN, or one of the PTIO options)
- Minimalism
- Settings/Permissions
- Updates (Automatic or frequent)

# Zone 2
- FOSS (Using FOSS as often as possible)
- Communication (Secure messengers, email insecurities and improvements)
- Google (Like...delete it)
- Password management part 2 (Use a password manager)
- 2FA (Use it)
- Browsers Part 2 (Firefox, Tor, Brave, Ung chromium)
- Radios (Disable them when not in use)
- User Accounts (Multiple users for different tasks, most notably a non-admin user for casual use)
- Physical (BIOS lockdown, cover cams, donâ€™t leave device out of site, shut down when leaving for extended periods, device lock)

# Zone 3
- Hardening:
  - Basic: https://linuxhint.com/linux_security_hardening_checklist/
  - Advanced: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/17/html/Security_Guide/chap-Security_Guide-Basic_Hardening.html
