# What is This? - Preface
Techlore has existed since December, 2014 - that's a LONG time! We ask everyone reading this to reflect on what they knew 5+ years ago and how much they've grown since then. We are no different. We made mistakes, we could have worded something better, we could have been more mature, etc. Rather than doing nothing, we wanted to take an active approach and use our mistakes as teaching lessons for our community (and hopefully other creators as well!)

In this doc, you'll see all the changes we've made to our channel's content and why each decision was made. We encourage everyone reads the reasoning and we hope this sparks healthy discussions throughout our communities.
