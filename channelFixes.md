# What is This? - Preface
Techlore has existed since December, 2014 - that's a LONG time! We ask everyone reading this to reflect on what they knew 5+ years ago and how much they've grown since then. We are no different. We made mistakes, we could have worded something better, we could have been more mature, etc. Rather than doing nothing, we wanted to take an active approach and use our mistakes as teaching lessons for our community (and hopefully other creators as well!)

In this doc, you'll see all the changes we've made to our channel's content and why each decision was made. We encourage everyone reads the reasoning and we hope this sparks healthy discussions throughout our communities.


## March 6th, 2021 Channel Changes
* [Free VPN Unlimited Lifetime For iPhone and iPad](https://youtu.be/ivF2dIz2lNM)

This is our first video with nearly half a million views! It recommends a free VPN with no particular business model or transparency. We were previously unaware of the complexity of VPNs, as many people are today. To help educate users, we decided to keep the video up, but add a disclaimer in the description, a pinned comment, in addition to adding a "LEGACY" tag in the title. The disclaimer is as-follows:

*Notice: This is a legacy video being kept up for educational purposes. You should be aware free VPNs are heavily discouraged due to the high likelihood of data misuse. We have done a lot of growing over the years and have gathered tools to help users learn properly about VPNs.*

* [Free Tor Browser For iPhone/iPad/Apple iOS Devices](https://youtu.be/wu9-WGYULwk)

Here is another oldie. This video recommends an application called "iOnion" to access Tor on iOS. While there is still no official Tor browser for iOS, the Tor team themselves recommend "Onion Browser", making the recommendation in this video a bad one. To help educate users, we decided to keep the video up, but add a disclaimer in the description, a pinned comment, in addition to adding a "LEGACY" tag in the title. The disclaimer is as-follows:

*Notice: This is a legacy video being kept up for educational purposes. iOnion is not recommended, and we recommend using the Tor-recommend "Onion Browser" from the App Store for the best safety on iOS. It's worth noting there is still no official Tor Browser for iOS, so we recommend sticking to other platforms if the option is available for maximum safety.*

* [Torrent Anonymously on Windows](https://youtu.be/-CyLOlp65Ro) & [Free Unlimited Lifetime VPN (Windows Setup)](https://youtu.be/TiTPDDPQgqg)

Both of these videos recommend the same VPN provider: SoftEther/VPNGate from a Japanese research team. While there is no evidence of data misuse, free VPNs should come with massive disclaimers when there are no accompanying business models. To help educate users, we decided to keep the videos up, but add a disclaimer in the description, a pinned comment, in addition to adding a "LEGACY" tag in the title. The disclaimer is as-follows:

*Notice: This is a legacy video being kept up for educational purposes. You should be aware free VPNs are heavily discouraged due to the high likelihood of data misuse. We have done a lot of growing over the years and have gathered tools to help users learn properly about VPNs.*

* [Free Phone/iPad/Apple iOS Jailbreak Screen Recorder](https://youtu.be/-KX-9g3dHQg)

This video is severely outdated with no room for educational benefit. We have opted to delist it. It is still accessible using the link above but doesn't publicly appear on YouTube organically. It has also been given a "LEGACY" tag.
